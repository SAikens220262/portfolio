      <p>Hello, my name is Shadeyah Aikens. I live in Brooklyn with my sister and my mom. I am a very joyful person and I'm also very sarcastic when people ask me questions when the answers are obvious. But I'm also very joyful and I like to have a good time with my friends. I'm a very hardworking kid and my favorite subjects would have to be ELA and or Math.</p>
