      <span>This project is a website that I created about myself. Some challenges I faced while working on this is finding out the right coding to make this website work, and using trial and error to correct the mistakes of the coding.</span>

      <span><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/181590053/" target=" blank">This project is a maze chase game I've created in the beggining of my computer science and coding journey. I faced the challenge of not having the bugs touch the maze, and making the coding work properly.</a></span>
      <span><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/183014626/" target=" blank">This project is another game I created at the start of computer science, I faced some challenges with this one too. One challenge was making the balls actually shoot out of the broom. </a></span>
      <span><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/179524403/#editor" target= blank">This project is a skit that I created with different coding blocks we've learned in Computer Science. I faced the challenges of having the different characters disappear when I needed them to, it was very hard putting the whole project together to actually look like an episode out of a tv show.</a>
